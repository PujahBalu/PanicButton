Emergency Notifier (Panic Button)

  Abstract: 
  
  Security for women has become a major issue as the number of crimes against women and girls is increasing day by day. The safety of women & children is a concern of increasing urgency in India and other countries. The primary issue in the handling of these cases by the police lies in constraints preventing them from responding quickly to calls of distress. These constraints include not knowing the location of the crime and not knowing the crime is occurring at all: at the victim's end, reaching the police assuredly and discreetly is a challenge. To aid in the removal of these constraints, this paper introduces a mobile application called Panic Button that provides not only women & children with a reliable way to send an emergency message to anyone. A message containing the geographical location of the user along with the latitude and longitude details will be immediately sent to the selected contact. This message is sent via SMS. This application can be used with and without your mobile data connection. This paper describes the application, its development, and its technical implementation.
